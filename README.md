## _Collects mood data for volunteers in the field_

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/66a7f8d8-8f29-4e31-a4ec-b7d84aed5385/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/feels/deploys)

This React app has been built to collect data from former and extant volunteers in-country, allowing such data to be collated and referenced to help provide feedback about the volunteering experince. 

It has been developed in preparation for an In Country Meeting (ICM) arranged by the vounteers currently in Nepal at time of writing.

## How is this app built?
There are two parts to this app, all of which is contained in this one repository. It has been built using [`create-react-app`](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/), and customised to be hosted and submit data to [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/) for its free hosting and data storage features.

## How do I work on this app?
You'll need to have some familiarity with React to customise this app, and [Netlify's Forms documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/) is instructive in managing the data submission.
